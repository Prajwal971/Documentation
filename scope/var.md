# var: 
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “__var__” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is “function scoped”.The scope of a variable declared with var is its current execution context.Assigning a value to an undeclared variable implicitly creates it as a global variable
