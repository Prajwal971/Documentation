# let:
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
“_let_” and “_const_” are “_block scoped_”.
\
let allows to declare variables that are limited to a scope of a block statement.Just like const the let does not create properties of the window object when declared globally.
