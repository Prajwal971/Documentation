# Hoisting
Keeping all the declartion of the variables to the top of the current scope is Hoisting. The variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase.
\
It means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
\
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
