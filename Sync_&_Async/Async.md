# Asynchronous
JavaScript is only asynchronous in the sense that it can make, for example, Ajax calls.
__Async__ functions will always return  a value.Is makes sure that promise is returned ...if not returned it will wrap the value in a promise.
A Javascript  code is said to execute asynchronoulsy when it is queued to run sometime after the event loop is available.Alert is a synchronous statement.

For Ex...\
    In asynchronous programs, you can have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), where L1 schedules some task to be run in the future, but L2 runs before that task completes.
