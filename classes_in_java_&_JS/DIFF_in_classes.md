# Difference in classes of JAvaScript and other programming languages.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript is a OOP scripting language whereas Java is an OOP programming language.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser, while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code does not.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Java, JavaScript is also an object oriented language, but JavaScript does not use classes.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In JavaScript we don't define classes and create objects from these classes.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript is prototype based, not class based.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do inheritance, you can use any object instance as a prototype
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In JavaScript, every object is at the same time an instance and a class. To do inheritance, you can use any object instance as a prototype.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other programming languages there are classes, and instances, as separate concepts. In order to do inheritance, you have to use the base class to create a new class, which can then be used to produce derived instances.
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects are first class citizens in JavaScript, so much that regular functions are also implemented as objects
\
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript supports object inheritance through something known as prototypes. There is an object property called prototype attached to each object.
