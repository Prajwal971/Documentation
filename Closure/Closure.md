# Closure
also called as nested function where the value of the varible is maintained over thr lexical environmental and remains available for use. OR Closure means that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
It can be useful to create private variables or functions.

3 scopes for closure
*Local scope
*Outer  Function scope
*Global scope
