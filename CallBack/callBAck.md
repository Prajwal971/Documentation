# Callbacks
A function which is passed as a parameter in another function .
Callbacks that are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed — these are called asynchronous callbacks.If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function, then callbacks can be used.

Callbacks are primarily used while handling asynchronous operations like – making an API request.
