# Interval
The __setInterval__ method repeatedly calls a function  with a fixed time delay between each call. It returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval.
The interval is usually in millisecs = 1000ms = 1sec.This method will continue, calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.

The __setTimeout()__ method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds.It returns the value returned by the timer initialization steps, passing them the method's arguments, the object on which the method for which the algorithm is running is implemented as the method context, and the repeat flag set to false

The __clearInterval()__ method clears a timer set with the setInterval() method.

The __clearTimeout()__ method clears a timer set with the setTimeout() method.
