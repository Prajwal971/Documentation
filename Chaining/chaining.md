# __Chaining__
_Chaining_ is also called as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. 

## __Syntax:__ _object.method().method().method()..._


## __Ex__: _str.replace("k", "R").toUpperCase().substr(0,4);_
    let a = new a();
    let b = a.setName('nothing').setColor('nocolor').setGender('Male');

It makes the code read  like a sentence.
